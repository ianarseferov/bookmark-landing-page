## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript DOM manipulation

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to make accordion and use css filter property for changing color of image

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.logo {
  filter: saturate(0.86) hue-rotate(170deg) invert(100%);
}
```

### Continued development

I will pay more attention to the css positions and layout structure in future projects

### Useful resources

- [window resize](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/resize_event) - This helped me for displaying hamburger menu icon small screen size. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
